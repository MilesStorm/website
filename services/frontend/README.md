# Development

The workspace contains the `web` crate, a `ui` crate for shared components and an `api` crate for shared backend logic:

```
your_project/
├─ README.md
├─ Cargo.toml
└─ packages/
   ├─ web/
   │  └─ ... # Web specific UI/logic
   ├─ api/
   │  └─ ... # All shared server logic
   └─  ui/
      └─ ... # Component shared between multiple platforms
```

## Shared UI crate

The workspace contains a `ui` crate with components that are shared between multiple platforms.  The `ui` crate starts out something like this:

```
ui/
├─ src/
│  ├─ lib.rs # The entrypoint for the ui crate
│  ├─ hero.rs # The Hero component that will be used in every platform
│  ├─ echo.rs # The shared echo component that communicates with the server
│  ├─ navbar.rs # The Navbar component that will be used in the layout of every platform's router
```

## Shared backend logic

The workspace contains a `api` crate with shared backend logic. This crate defines the shared server functions. Server functions are async functions that expose a public API on the server. They can be called like a normal async function from the client. When you run `dx serve`, all of the server functions will be collected in the server build and hosted on a public API for the client to call. The `api` crate starts out something like this:

```
api/
├─ src/
│  ├─ lib.rs # Exports a server function that echos the input string
```

### Serving Your App

Navigate to the web crate:
```bash
cd web
```

and serve:

```bash
dx serve
```
